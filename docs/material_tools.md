# Material/Texture Tools

## Material -> Viewport Color / Random Material Viewport Colors
Transfer Material Base Color to Viewport Color for Solid View Mode. Or Generate Random Colors for Materials for Viewport.

## Clear UV Maps/Clear Vertex Color
Just remove all UV Maps or all Vertex Colors from selected objects.

## Delete Unused Materials
Delete from selected objects unused materials (not applyed to faces) and unused material slots.

## Create Palette Textures (Albedo, Roughness, Metallic, Opacity and Emission)
Create Palette Textures (32x32px) for Selected Objects painted with colored materials. In one palette texture can be up to 256 colors (materials).

## Quick Select Texture from Active material in UV Editor

## Active Material -> Selected
Assign active material to selected faces in MultiEdit Mode.

## Cleanup Duplicated Materials
Remove duplicate materials (by name). Useful when importing many models with the same materials but from different files. In this case, Blender creates many copies of the materials. This function allows you to find and assign the original materials to all models.
