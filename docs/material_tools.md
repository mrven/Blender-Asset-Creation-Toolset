Create Palette Textures (32x32px) for Selected Objects painted with colored materials. In one palette texture can be up to 256 colors (materials).

## Quick Select Texture from Active material in UV Editor

## Cleanup Duplicated Materials

Remove duplicate materials (by name). Useful when importing many models with the same materials but from different files. In this case, Blender creates many copies of the materials. This function allows you to find and assign the original materials to all models.
